# Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles

## Introduction

Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles (ESPs) are a scientific product to
support [Integrated Ecosystem
Assessment](https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/) (IEA).
IEA seeks to improve understanding and management of fisheries through
incorporating natural, social, and economic data into fisheries analyses
and management plans. ESPs are a structured framework developed by the
Alaska Fisheries Science Center to integrate ecosystem and socioeconomic
information into the stock assessment
process.<sup>[1](https://meetings.npfmc.org/CommentReview/DownloadFile?p=8f5233fb-3b62-4571-9b49-8bb7ce675916.pdf&fileName=ESP_Shotwell.pdf)</sup>

Here we adapt the ESP process for use in the management of Northeast
stocks. Our scientific roadmap consists of these steps:

1.  Review information from the national initiatives and regional
    priorities to determine if a fish stock is a priority for producing
    an ESP. Determine priority stocks and assemble an ESP project team.

2.  Identify vulnerabilities to overfishing, ecological pressures, and
    climate change throughout the life stages of the stock. Combine this
    information with ecosystem and socioeconomic processes driving stock
    dynamics. Conduct a literature review and develop models outlining
    major environmental and economic drivers of the stock’s
    distribution, life cycle, and fishery.

3.  Create, select, analyze and monitor a suite of indicators of the
    health of the stock and fishery. Conduct tests on trends between
    ecosystem and socioeconomic indicators and stock metrics.

4.  The final step culminates in a stock-specific report and
    presentations that concisely convey the status of leading indicators
    to fisheries scientists and managers.

## Using this package

Data, functions, and report templates are aggregated in this R package,
[`NEesp2`](https://github.com/NEFSC/READ-EDAB-NEesp2). See
[here](https://nefsc.github.io/READ-EDAB-NEesp/articles/install-and-use-package.html)
for a brief demo of how to use this package.

## NEesp2 package

This package is a derivative of the original Northeast ESP R package.
All relevant data, functions, and methods for ESP reports prior to 2024
will be found in this package
[`NEFSC/READ-EDAB-NEesp`](https://github.com/NEFSC/READ-EDAB-NEesp).

## Next steps

This package is currently in development. Standard ecosystem and
socioeconomic indicator data and methods, visualizations, and report
templates will be added shortly.
