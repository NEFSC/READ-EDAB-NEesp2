# Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles 

## Introduction
Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles (ESPs) are a scientific product to support [Integrated Ecosystem Assessment](https://www.integratedecosystemassessment.noaa.gov/) (IEA). IEA seeks to improve understanding and management of fisheries through incorporating natural, social, and economic data into fisheries analyses and management plans. ESPs are a structured framework developed by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center to integrate ecosystem and socioeconomic information into the stock assessment process.<sup>[1]</sup>

Here we adapt the ESP process for use in the management of Northeast stocks. Our scientific roadmap consists of these steps:

1. Review information from the national initiatives and regional priorities to determine if a fish stock is a priority for producing an ESP. Determine priority stocks and assemble an ESP project team.

2. Identify vulnerabilities to overfishing, ecological pressures, and climate change throughout the life stages of the stock. Combine this information with ecosystem and socioeconomic processes driving stock dynamics. Conduct a literature review and develop models outlining major environmental and economic drivers of the stockâ€™s distribution, life cycle, and fishery.

3. Create, select, analyze and monitor a suite of indicators of the health of the stock and fishery. Conduct tests on trends between ecosystem and socioeconomic indicators and stock metrics.

4. The final step culminates in a stock-specific report and presentations that concisely convey the status of leading indicators to fisheries scientists and managers.

## Using this package
Data, functions, and report templates are aggregated in this R package, [`NEesp2`](https://github.com/NEFSC/READ-EDAB-NEesp2). See [here](https://nefsc.github.io/READ-EDAB-NEesp/articles/install-and-use-package.html) for a brief demo of how to use this package.

## NEesp2 package 
This package is a derivative of the original Northeast ESP R package. All relevant data, functions, and methods for ESP reports prior to 2024 will be found in this package [`NEFSC/READ-EDAB-NEesp`](https://github.com/NEFSC/READ-EDAB-NEesp).

## Next steps
This package is currently in development. Standard ecosystem and socioeconomic indicator data and methods, visualizations, and report templates will be added shortly.
